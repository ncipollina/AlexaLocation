# Alexa Tutorial - Using Location With an Alexa Skill
One of the coolest things about Amazon's line of echo devices is the fact that you the developer can build new skills for users to use on their devices.  As a developer you can build a variety of types of skills, but the type this post will focus on is a Custom Skill.  A custom skill is a skill that you design what the skill can handle and the words that users say to invoke your skill.  These skills can be games such as trivia or choose-your-own-adventure skills, helpful skills such as alarm clocks or list skills, and education skills such as spelling skills or counting skills just to name a few.

One useful thing that you can use in your custom skill is your user's address information.  This information can be used for a variety of reasons.  If you were building a skill to request a rideshare such as Uber, or Lyft, you would need to know a users exact address. For a skill used by a retailer to find the closest physical store, knowing the zip code might be sufficient. If you were building a game skill and you wanted to keep high scores by location, knowing what part of the country might be enough. In the interest of protecting your privacy, address information requires you as the user to grant permission to the skill to have access to your phsysical address.  This blog post will detail the steps to accomplish this.
